# Bkmrkr

A simple bookmarking app

## Setup

  ```ruby
  gem install bundler && bundle install
  rake db:create
  rake db:migrate
  ```

## Testing

Uses cucumber with some steps generated by pickle and cucumber training wheels

  ```
  rake
  ```

## Gotchas

When a domain and bookmark is created, Nokogiri goes and grabs the title of the page. Ideally, this should be in a delayed job so that if the url doesn't respond it doesn't break. For some reason, Nokogiri doesn't like being in a delayed job though, so this will happen before_create.
